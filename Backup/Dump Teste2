LADEN :Agora Ã© hora de acabar com  
       suas atrocidades, e por um    
       fim nisso tudo.                             
                                    
GYRA  :Ha ha ha... You're ambitious,
       but you will never defeat me.
LADEN :ENOUGH TALKING. LET'S FIGHT! 
GYRA  :First I have a little        
       surprise for you. Look at my 
       face.                        
                                    
                                    
LADEN :I can't believe it!          
GYRA  :Long time , no see, Laden.   
LADEN :Can you really be Roki?  It's
       impossible!                  
GYRA  :But it is true, Laden.  Your 
       brother, Roki entered another
       world and became a new       
       man-Gyra,Lord of Darkness.   
LADEN :No. This can't be true!      
                                    
                                    
GYRA  :Join me. Let's work together 
       and we can conquer the world.
LADEN :You are a fool.              
GYRA  :The only fools are those who 
       try to stop me now.          
LADEN :Is this truly what has become
       of my brother?               
                                    
                                    
GYRA  :Clauss and Salome, come here.
                                    
                                    
CLAUSS:My King, we are ready to     
       capture King Lorelei.        
                                    
                                    
SALOME:And we shall also capture the
       ELEMENTAL.                   
                                    
                                    
GYRA  :Everything is going according
       to my plans. There is no     
       turning back now.            
                                    
                                    
CLAUSS:We understand, my King.      
                                    
                                    
SALOME:We will obey, my King.       
                                    
                                    
GYRA  :I have no more time to waste 
       on you. We will meet again...
       If you live that long.       
LADEN :Roki, please wait!           
GYRA  :Ha ha ha ha ha......         
                                    
                                    
LADEN :Roki, why, why?              
                                    
                                    
NEENA :You saved my life! Thank you.
LADEN :Who are you?                 
NEENA :My name is Neena, I serve the
       ELEMENTAL, but we were       
       captured.                    
LADEN :You're safe now. You can     
       return home.                 
NEENA :No. You save my life so now I
       will follow you.             
LADEN :It's too dangerous for you.  
NEENA :It is my duty now to help you
       regardless of the danger.    
LADEN :Hey, wait!                   
                                    
                                    
NEENA :You are the one I have been  
       seeking.                     
LADEN :Who are you?                 
NEENA :I am the reincarnation of the
       legendary ring. The ring with
       the ability to channel the   
       power of the Elements.       
LADEN :So it is you.                
NEENA :Yes, I have been testing you.
       I needed to know if you were 
       worthy.                      
NEENA :Your enemy is strong. The    
       power of Darkness protects   
       Clauss and Salome. Only the  
       power of light can defeat    
       them.                        
                                    
                                    
NEENA :Put me on your finger, I can 
       give you the power of the    
       Elements.                    
                                    
                                    
LADEN :Neena.                       
                                    
                                    
LADEN :Roki!                        
                                    
                                    
ROKI  :You have grown stronger since
       we last met,Laden.           
LADEN :What has happened to you,    
       brother?                     
ROKI  :I have made many mistakes. I 
       thought the power of Darkness
       would make me invincible.    
       When I heard this power was  
       locked away under the city, I
       went in search of it.        
       I found the dark power, but  
       when I unleashed its forces, 
       I was overcome by the spirit 
       of King Gyra.  His evil      
       possessed me.                
LADEN :....                         
ROKI  :I see now that King Gyra was 
       a reflection of the evil in  
       my own heart. I created the  
       monster that was King Gyra.  
LADEN :It's not true. In your heart,
       you are good!                
ROKI  :LADEN......                  
LADEN :NO!                          
ROKI  :My eyes are growing dim. It's
       time for me to depart this   
       world. Good bye, my brother. 
                                    
                                    
LADEN :Roki! Roki!! Don't die now!! 
                                    
                                    
King Lorelei was freed.             
The followers of Gyra were never    
heard from again.
