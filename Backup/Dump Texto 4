LADEN :Gyra!!!                      \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
LADEN :Agora Ã© hora de acabar com   \n
       suas atrocidades, e por um   \n
	   nisso tudo.\n                \n
GYRA  :Ha ha ha... You're ambitious,\n
       but you will never defeat me.\n
LADEN :ENOUGH TALKING. LET'S FIGHT! \n
GYRA  :First I have a little        \n
       surprise for you. Look at my \n
       face.                        \n
	   \n                                    \n
LADEN :I can't believe it!          \n
GYRA  :Long time , no see, Laden.   \n
LADEN :Can you really be Roki?  It's\n
       impossible!                  \n
GYRA  :But it is true, Laden.  Your \n
       brother, Roki entered another\n
       world and became a new       \n
       man-Gyra,Lord of Darkness.   \n
LADEN :No. This can't be true!      \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
GYRA  :Join me. Let's work together \n
       and we can conquer the world.\n
LADEN :You are a fool.              \n
GYRA  :The only fools are those who \n
       try to stop me now.          \n
LADEN :Is this truly what has become\n
       of my brother?               \n
	   \n                                    \n
GYRA  :Clauss and Salome, come here.\n
                                    \n
                                    \n
CLAUSS:My King, we are ready to     \n
       capture King Lorelei.        \n
	   \n                                    \n
SALOME:And we shall also capture the\n
       ELEMENTAL.                   \n
	   \n                                    \n
GYRA  :Everything is going according\n
       to my plans. There is no     \n
       turning back now.            \n
	   \n                                    \n
CLAUSS:We understand, my King.      \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
SALOME:We will obey, my King.       \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
GYRA  :I have no more time to waste \n
       on you. We will meet again...\n
       If you live that long.       \n
LADEN :Roki, please wait!           \n
GYRA  :Ha ha ha ha ha......         \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
LADEN :Roki, why, why?              \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
NEENA :You saved my life! Thank you.\n
LADEN :Who are you?                 \n
NEENA :My name is Neena, I serve the\n
       ELEMENTAL, but we were       \n
       captured.                    \n
LADEN :You're safe now. You can     \n
       return home.                 \n
NEENA :No. You save my life so now I\n
       will follow you.             \n
LADEN :It's too dangerous for you.  \n
NEENA :It is my duty now to help you\n
       regardless of the danger.    \n
LADEN :Hey, wait!                   \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
NEENA :You are the one I have been  \n
       seeking.                     \n
LADEN :Who are you?                 \n
NEENA :I am the reincarnation of the\n
       legendary ring. The ring with\n
       the ability to channel the   \n
       power of the Elements.       \n
LADEN :So it is you.                \n
NEENA :Yes, I have been testing you.\n
       I needed to know if you were \n
       worthy.                      \n
NEENA :Your enemy is strong. The    \n
       power of Darkness protects   \n
       Clauss and Salome. Only the  \n
       power of light can defeat    \n
       them.                        \n
	   \n                                    \n
NEENA :Put me on your finger, I can \n
       give you the power of the    \n
       Elements.                    \n
	   \n                                    \n
LADEN :Neena.                       \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
LADEN :Roki!                        \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
ROKI  :You have grown stronger since\n
       we last met,Laden.           \n
LADEN :What has happened to you,    \n
       brother?                     \n
ROKI  :I have made many mistakes. I \n
       thought the power of Darkness\n
       would make me invincible.    \n
       When I heard this power was  \n
       locked away under the city, I\n
       went in search of it.        \n
       I found the dark power, but  \n
       when I unleashed its forces, \n
       I was overcome by the spirit \n
       of King Gyra.  His evil      \n
       possessed me.                \n
LADEN :....                         \n
ROKI  :I see now that King Gyra was \n
       a reflection of the evil in  \n
       my own heart. I created the  \n
       monster that was King Gyra.  \n
LADEN :It's not true. In your heart,\n
       you are good!                \n
	   ROKI  :LADEN......                  \n
LADEN :NO!                          \n
ROKI  :My eyes are growing dim. It's\n
       time for me to depart this   \n
       world. Good bye, my brother. \n
	   \n                                    \n
LADEN :Roki! Roki!! Don't die now!! \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
King Lorelei was freed.             \n
The followers of Gyra were never    \n
heard from again.                   \n
                                    \n
                                    \n
